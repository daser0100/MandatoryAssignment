## Description of the project
This is the repository for our mandatory assignment.

The goal of the project is to make a website containing a personal perofolio with different information about us.

We desided to make a website for a kichen at H. C. Kollegiet in Odense. At H. C. Kollegiet 15 apartments share a kitchen, so our website is a platform to organize and plan different thing for the members of the kitchen.

The website have 4 sites:

### About me
The "About me" page is where the information about the kitchen can be found. As default the site has been seeded with agreements/guidelines for the kitchen. The content of the page can be edited at the "Admin" page. If the database that holds the informations is emptied, the database is automaticaly filled with the default information. 

### Gallery
The "Gallery" page is suposed to be a place where pictures can be displayed. The page contain a lightbox like structure for showing the pictures. At the "Admin" page it is possible to add and remove pictures from the site. Pictures are added to the website by an URL.

### News
The "News" page contain a sign up form for signing up to a newsletter. 

### Admin
The "Admin" page can be reach by adding "/home/admin" to the URL.

This page contains links to the admin pages for the three other pages. At the admin pages for the other pages it is possible to add, remove or edit content of the pages.
